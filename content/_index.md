# Hi, I'm ymstnt

I'm a university student, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 🏛️ I enjoy tinkering with computers, especially Linux (NixOS btw ❄️), self-hosting various things, and coding. ☕ I also like video games, 🎮 writing, and taking care of my aquarium. 🐟

On this site, you'll find my projects and my random thoughts that I decide to write down. Enjoy your stay! ☺️
